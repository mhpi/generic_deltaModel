A generic framework for building [differentiable models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-023-00450-9). ùõøMG enables seamless coupling of neural networks with differentiable process-based equations, leveraging PyTorch's auto-differentiation for efficient, large-scale optimization on GPU. The spiritual successor to [HydroDL](https://github.com/zhonghu17/HydroDL), ùõøMG generalizes differentiable modeling for cross-domain application while also imposing basic standardizations for research-to-operations pipelines.

### Key Features

- ü§ù **Hybrid Modeling**: Combine neural networks with process-based equations for enhanced interpretability and generalizability. Instead of manual model parameter calibration, for instance, use neural networks to directly learn robust and interpretable parameters ([Tsai et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26107-z)).
- üîÅ **PyTorch Integration**: Scale with PyTorch for efficient training and compatibility with modern ML tools and numerical solvers.
- üß© **Modular Plugin Architecture**: Swap in domain-specific components and configurations with ease.
- ‚ö° **Benchmarking**: All in one place. ùõøMG + hydroDL2 will enable rapid deployment and replication of key published MHPI results.
- üåä **NextGen-ready**: Designed for [CSDMS BMI](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/BMI) compliance to support differentiable hydrological models in [NOAA-OWP](https://water.noaa.gov/about/owp)'s [NextGen National Water Modeling Framework](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen). See the NextGen-ready [ùõøHBV2.0](https://github.com/mhpi/dHBV2.0) with ùõøMG-supported BMI for an example.

</br>

ùõøMG is designed to scale with modern deep learning tools (e.g., foundation models) while maintaining physical interpretability. Our peer-reviewed and published [benchmarks](https://mhpi.github.io/benchmarks/#10-year-training-comparison) show that well-tuned differentiable models can match deep networks in performance‚Äîwhile better extrapolating to extreme or data-scarce conditions and predicting physically meaningful variables.

Differentiable modeling introduces more modeling choices than traditional deep learning due to its physical constraints. This includes learning parameters, missing process representations, corrections, or other enhancements for physical models.

**Note**: While differentiable models are powerful and have many desirable characteristics, they come with a larger decision space than purely data-driven neural networks since physical processes are involved, and can thus feel "trickier" to work with. Hence, *we recommend* beginning with our example [notebooks](./example/hydrology/) and then systematically making changes, one at a time. Pay attention to multifaceted outputs, diverse causal analyses, and predictions of untrained variables permitted by differentiable models, rather than purely trying to outperform other models' metrics.

## Installation

To install ùõøMG, clone the repo and install in developer mode with [Astral UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mhpi/generic_deltamodel.git
uv pip install -e ./generic_deltamodel
```

Pip and Conda are also supported, though UV is recommended. See [setup](./docs/setup.md) for further details.

</br>

## Quick Start

See [how to run](./docs/how_to_run.md).

**Example -- Differentiable Parameter Learning**: Use an LSTM to learn parameters for the [HBV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBV_hydrology_model) hydrological model.

```python
from hydroDL2.models.hbv.hbv import HBV

from dMG.core.data.loaders import HydroLoader
from dMG.core.utils import load_nn_model, print_config, set_randomseed
from dMG.models.delta_models import DplModel
from example import load_config, take_data_sample

CONFIG_PATH = '../example/conf/config_dhbv_1_0.yaml'


# Model configuration
config = load_config(CONFIG_PATH)

# Initialize physical model and NN.
phy_model = HBV(config['delta_model']['phy_model'])
nn = load_nn_model(phy_model, config['delta_model'])

# Create differentiable model dHBV: a torch.nn.Module that describes how 
# the NN is linked to the physical model HBV.
dpl_model = DplModel(phy_model=phy_model, nn_model=nn)

# Load dataset of NN and HBV inputs.
dataset = HydroLoader(config).dataset
dataset_sample = take_data_sample(config, dataset, days=730, basins=100)

output = dpl_model(dataset_sample)
```

This exposes a key characteristic of the differentiable model `DplModel`: composition of a physical model, `phy_model`, and a neural network, `nn`. Internally, `DplModel` looks like

```python
# NN forward
parameters = self.nn_model(dataset_sample['xc_nn_norm'])        

# Physics model forward
predictions = self.phy_model(
    dataset_sample,
    parameters,
)
```

Check out [examples](https://github.com/mhpi/generic_deltamodel/tree/master/example/hydrology) to see model training/testing/simulation in detail. We recommend starting [here](./example/hydrology/example_dhbv_1_0.ipynb), which is a continuation of the above. A [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19PRLrI-L7cGeYzkk2tOetULzQK8s_W7v?usp=sharing) for this Œ¥HBV example is also available.

## Use Cases

### 1. Lumped Hydrology

Lumped differentiable rainfall-runoff models [ùõøHBV 1.0](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2022WR032404) and improved [ùõøHBV 1.1p](https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.172304428.82707157).

### 2. Unseen Extreme Events Test with ùõøHBV 1.1p

In the unseen extreme events spatial test, we used water years with a 5-year or lower return period peak flow from 1990/10/01 to 2014/09/30 for training, and held out the water years with greater than a 5-year return period peak flow for testing. The spatial test was conducted using a 5-fold cross-validation approach for basins in the [CAMELS dataset](https://gdex.ucar.edu/dataset/camels.html). This application has been benchmarked against LSTM and demonstrates better extrapolation abilities. Find more details and results in [Song, Sawadekar, et al. (2024)](https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.172304428.82707157).
