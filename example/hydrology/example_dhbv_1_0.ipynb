    "\n",
    "In general, differentiable modeling represents the coupling of a neural network and a (differentiable) physical model. This enables several capabilities, like introducing missing processses and bias corrections. In the applications of these notebooks, we demonstrate parameter learning;\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics models include parameters for which True values are seldom known, but can be approximated with various methods. By coupling a neural network, we can learn a set of a physics model's parameters (static or dynamic in, e.g., time), which can then be passed alongside other input variables to the physical model for making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $\\delta$ HBV 1.0, we use an LSTM neural network (NN) in concert with the physical model HBV (Beck 2020; Seibert 2005). HBV uses input forcing (time-varying) variables precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration (PET) accross a collection of hydrologic basins, with physical parameters learned at the same spatiotemporal resolution [timesteps, basins], to make predictions about hydrologic states and fluxes (e.g., streamflow in our case) in both space and time. In general, this differentiable model takes the form\n",

    "- #### Set Model, Experiment, Dataset Configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "    Two flexible YAML configuration files exist for augmenting behaviors of the dMG framework: One defines model settings and training/testing parameters, and another, defines parameters for your dataset (observations). For this tutorial, two such configuration files have been created and require minimal preparation to use in this notebook:\n",

    "    1. `/example/conf/config_dhbv_1_0.yaml` -- Model/experiment settings\n",

    "\n",
    "    With these, all aspects of dMG model creation, training, testing, etc. can be controlled. As it is, the model/experiment config is setup to use reproduce benchmark results for [$\\delta$ HBV 1.0](#publication) (see [here](https://mhpi.github.io/benchmarks/#10-year-training-comparison)) using the CAMELS 531-basin subset of weather forcings and static basin attributes. Full 671-basin benchmark models can also be trained/tested, and both can be configured by setting the following options in the model config:\n",

    "    - For CAMELS 531-basin, 10-year benchmark (Default):\n",
    "        - `observations: camels_531`\n",

    "- #### Building the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are two ways to build a differentiable model in dMG:\n",
    "    - **Implicit**: Best for small-scale experiments and distribution of final products.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Add/change modules in dMG to create your own differentiable model, and tailor model and dataset configuration files like `deltaModel/conf/config.yaml` and `deltaModel/conf/observations/{dataset}.yaml` to reflect desired behaviors model and experiment behaviors. (Modules like trainers, physics models, neural networks, loss functions, and data loaders/samplers are designed to be hot-swappable per user needs. The differentiable model modality will also be made more flexible to meet diverse modeling needs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "        With these this done, dMG can be run with\n",
    "        ```shell\n",
    "        cd ./deltaModel\n",
    "        python __main__.py\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Explicit**: Best for exploratory research and prototyping (illustrated in the code block below).\n",
    "\n",
    "        This approach is similar in that we still use config files to hold settings (though\n",
    "        a dictionary object could also be used). The difference is that we are able to expose the fundamental steps in the\n",
    "        modeling process; data preprocesing, model building, and experimentation/forwarding. In doing so, we make it\n",
    "        quicker to develop model and data pipelines, and easier to follow internal processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an explicit implementation of dMG to create and forward $\\delta$ HBV 1.0:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Load a configuration file**: Using Hydra and OmegaConf packages, we can convert the model/dataset configs into a dictionary object `config`. For example, if your config file contains `mode: train`, the dictionary yields `config['mode'] == 'train'`. However, the config can also contain sub-dictionaries. For instance, \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```yaml\n",
    "    training: \n",
    "        start_time: 1999/10/01\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    which is accessed like `config['training']['start_time'] == '1999/10/01'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Initialize sub-models**: Next, we initialize the physics model and neural network our differentiable model will use, in this case an LSTM from `deltaModel/models/neural_networks/lstm_models.py` and HBV 1.0 from [HydroDL2](https://github.com/mhpi/hydroDL2).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Load in data**: At this step, we load and process our data as a dictionary of variable and attribute datasets that are used by the neural network and physics model. This dataset_dict is created by a data_loader, and should meet minimum requirements of the base class `deltaModel/core/data/data_loaders/base.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For this example, we take a small, arbitrarily selected sample of the data to illustrate the modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Create a differentiable model**: Now, the sub-models are linked together by a differentiable model wrapper (`DeltaModel`). This has the effect of interfacing both models to achieve the desired modality, e.g., having the LSTM generate parameters for HBV. \n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Forward/Experiment**: With the differentiable model created, it can be forwarded (as demonstrated\n",
    "    below), or trained/tested/applied in any user-defined experiments.\n",
